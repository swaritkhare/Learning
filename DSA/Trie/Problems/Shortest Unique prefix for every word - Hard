Problem Statement:
Given an array of words, find all shortest unique prefixes to represent each word in the given array. Assume that no word is prefix of another.

Example 1:
Input: 
N = 4
arr[] = {"zebra", "dog", "duck", "dove"}
Output: z dog du dov
Explanation: 
z => zebra 
dog => dog 
duck => du 
dove => dov 
Example 2:
Input: 
N = 3
arr[] =  {"geeksgeeks", "geeksquiz",
                       "geeksforgeeks"};
Output: geeksg geeksq geeksf
Explanation: 
geeksgeeks => geeksg 
geeksquiz => geeksq 
geeksforgeeks => geeksf

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*length of each word)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*length of each word)

Solution:
