Problem Statement:
Geek is at the geek summer carnival. He is given an array of N strings. To unlock exclusive course discounts he needs to find the longest common prefix among all strings present in the array. Can you help him ?

Example 1:
Input:
N = 4
ar[] = {geeksforgeeks, geeks, geek, geezer}
Output:
gee
Explanation: 
Longest common prefix in all the given string is gee. 

Example 2:

Expected time complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected space complexity: O(string length)

Solution:
