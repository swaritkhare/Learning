Problem Statement:
Given an array of strings arr[] of size N, find if there exists 2 strings arr[i] and arr[j] such that arr[i]+arr[j] is a palindrome i.e the concatenation of string arr[i] and arr[j] results into a palindrome.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 6
arr[] = {"geekf", "geeks", "or","keeg", "abc", 
          "bc"}
Output: 1 
Explanation: There is a pair "geekf"
and "keeg".
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {"abc", "xyxcba", "geekst", "or", "bc"}
Output: 1
Explanation: There is a pair "abc"
and "xyxcba".

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*l2) where l = length of longest string in arr[]
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*l2) where l = length of longest string in arr[]

Solution:
