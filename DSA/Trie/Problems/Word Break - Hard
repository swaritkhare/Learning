Problem Statement:
Given a string A and a dictionary of n words B, find out if A can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words. 

Example 1:
Input:
n = 12
B = { "i", "like", "sam", "sung", "samsung",
"mobile","ice","cream", "icecream", "man",
"go", "mango" }, A = "ilike"
Output: 1
Explanation: The string can be segmented as
"i like".
Example 2:
Input: 
n = 12 
B = { "i", "like", "sam", "sung", "samsung",
"mobile","ice","cream", "icecream", "man", 
"go", "mango" }, A = "ilikesamsung" 
Output: 1
Explanation: The string can be segmented as 
"i like samsung" or "i like sam sung".

Expected time complexity: O(n*l+|A|2) where l is the leght of longest string present in the dictionary and |A| is the length of string A
Expected auxiliary space: O(|A| + k) , where k = sum of length of all strings present in B

Solution:
