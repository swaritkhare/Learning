Problem Statement:
Given two distinct words startWord and targetWord, and a list denoting wordList of unique words of equal lengths. Find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from startWord to targetWord. You can return them in any order possible.
Keep the following conditions in mind:

A word can only consist of lowercase characters.
Only one letter can be changed in each transformation.
Each transformed word must exist in the wordList including the targetWord.
startWord may or may not be part of the wordList.
Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
The first part of this problem can be found here.

Example:
Input:
startWord = "der", targetWord = "dfs",
wordList = {"des","der","dfr","dgt","dfs"}
Output:
der dfr dfs
der des dfs
Explanation:
The length of the smallest transformation is 3.
And the following are the only two ways to get
to targetWord:-
"der" -> "des" -> "dfs".
"der" -> "dfr" -> "dfs".

Expected Time Compelxity: O(N*(logN * M * 26))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N * M) where N = length of wordList and M = |wordListi|

Solution:
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> findSequences(String startWord,
                                                      String targetWord,
                                                      String[] wordList) {
        // Code here
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<String>();
        int len = wordList.length;
        for(int i =0; i< len; i ++){
            set.add(wordList[i]);
        }
        Queue<ArrayList<String>> q = new LinkedList<ArrayList<String>>();
        ArrayList<String> st = new ArrayList<String>();
        st.add(startWord);
        q.add(st);
        ArrayList<String> usedonlevel = new ArrayList<String>();
        int level = 0;
        ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            ArrayList<String> data = q.peek();
            q.remove();
            
            if(data.size() > level){
                level++;
                for(String it : usedonlevel){
                    set.remove(it);
                }
            }
            String word = data.get(data.size() -1);
            if(word.equals(targetWord)== true){
                if(ans.size() == 0){
                    ans.add(data);
                }
                else if(ans.get(0).size() == data.size()){
                    ans.add(data);
                }
            }
            
            for(int i = 0; i< word.length(); i++){
                for(char ch = 'a'; ch<= 'z' ; ch++){
                    char [] original = word.toCharArray();
                    original[i] = ch;
                    String remdata = new String(original);
                    if(set.contains(remdata) == true){
                       data.add(remdata);
                       ArrayList<String> temp = new ArrayList<>(data);
                       q.add(temp);
                       usedonlevel.add(remdata);
                       data.remove(remdata);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

Intuition:
The intuition behind using the BFS traversal technique for these kinds of problems is that if we notice carefully, we go on replacing the characters one by one which seems just like we’re moving level-wise in order to reach the destination i.e. the targetWord. Here, in the example below we can notice there are two possible paths in order to reach the targetWord.

Contrary to the previous problem, here we do not stop the traversal on the first occurrence of the targetWord, but rather continue it for as many occurrences of the word as possible as we need all the shortest possible sequences in order to reach the destination word. The only trick here is that we do not have to delete a particular word immediately from the wordList even if during the replacement of characters it matches with the transformed word. Instead, we delete it after the traversal for a particular level when completed which allows us to explore all possible paths. This allows us to discover multiple sequences in order to reach the targetWord involving similar words. 

From the above figure, we can configure that there can be 2 shortest possible sequences in order to reach the word ‘cog’.

Approach:
This problem uses the BFS traversal technique for finding out all the shortest possible transformation sequences by exploring all possible ways in which we can reach the targetWord.

Initial configuration:

Queue: Define a queue data structure to store the level-wise formed sequences. The queue will be storing a List of strings, which will be representing the path till now. The last word in the list will be the last converted word. 
Hash set: Create a hash set to store the elements present in the word list to carry out the search and delete operations in O(1) time. 
Vector: Define a 1D vector ‘usedOnLevel’ to store the words which are currently being used for transformation on a particular level and a 2D vector ‘ans’ for storing all the shortest sequences of transformation.
The Algorithm for this problem involves the following steps:

Firstly, we start by creating a hash set to store all the elements present in the wordList which would make the search and delete operations faster for us to implement.
Next, we create a Queue data structure for storing the successive sequences/ path in the form of a vector which on transformation would lead us to the target word.
Now, we add the startWord to the queue as a List and also push it into the usedOnLevel vector to denote that this word is currently being used for transformation in this particular level.
Pop the first element out of the queue and carry out the BFS traversal, where for each word that popped out from the back of the sequence present at the top of the queue, we check for all of its characters by replacing them with ‘a’ - ‘z’ if they are present in the wordList or not. In case a word is present in the wordList, we simply first push it onto the usedOnLevel vector and do not delete it from the wordList immediately.
Now, push that word into the vector containing the previous sequence and add it to the queue. So we will get a new path, but we need to explore other paths as well, so pop the word out of the list to explore other paths.
After completion of traversal on a particular level, we can now delete all the words that were currently being used on that level from the usedOnLevel vector which ensures that these words won’t be used again in the future, as using them in the later stages will mean that it won’t be the shortest path anymore.
If at any point in time we find out that the last word in the sequence present at the top of the queue is equal to the target word, we simply push the sequence into the resultant vector if the resultant vector ‘ans’ is empty.
If the vector is not empty, we check if the current sequence length is equal to the first element added in the ans vector or not. This has to be checked because we need the shortest possible transformation sequences.
In case, there is no transformation sequence possible, we return an empty 2D vector.

// 1. Initialize the Word Set:
// java
// Copy code
// Set<String> set = new HashSet<String>();
// int len = wordList.length;
// for(int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
//     set.add(wordList[i]);
// }
// A HashSet<String> named set is created to store all the words from wordList.
// The reason for using a HashSet is that it provides O(1) average-time complexity for lookups, making it efficient to check if a word exists in the set.
// The code loops through the wordList and adds each word to set.
// 2. Initialize BFS (Breadth-First Search) Structures:
// java
// Copy code
// Queue<ArrayList<String>> q = new LinkedList<ArrayList<String>>();
// ArrayList<String> st = new ArrayList<String>();
// st.add(startWord);
// q.add(st);
// ArrayList<String> usedonlevel = new ArrayList<String>();
// int level = 0;
// ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
// A queue q is created to perform BFS. Each element in the queue is an ArrayList<String> that represents a sequence of transformations.
// A list st is created to store the initial sequence, which only contains startWord.
// The queue q is initialized with st, starting the BFS with the startWord.
// An ArrayList<String> named usedonlevel is used to keep track of the words that have been used in the current level of BFS. This helps in removing words from the set once the level is complete.
// level keeps track of the depth of the BFS (i.e., how many transformations deep we are).
// ans is an ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> that will store all the shortest transformation sequences.
// 3. Start BFS Loop:
// java
// Copy code
// while (!q.isEmpty()) {
//     ArrayList<String> data = q.peek();
//     q.remove();
// The BFS loop runs until the queue is empty.
// The code retrieves the sequence at the front of the queue using q.peek() and then removes it from the queue using q.remove().
// 4. Manage BFS Levels:
// java
// Copy code
// if (data.size() > level) {
//     level++;
//     for (String it : usedonlevel) {
//         set.remove(it);
//     }
// }
// If the current sequence's size exceeds the current level, it means we're moving to the next level of BFS.
// The level is incremented, and all words stored in usedonlevel (which were used in the previous level) are removed from the set.
// Removing these words ensures that we don't use them again in sequences that are longer than the shortest sequence.
// 5. Check for Target Word:
// java
// Copy code
// String word = data.get(data.size() - 1);
// if (word.equals(targetWord)) {
//     if (ans.size() == 0) {
//         ans.add(data);
//     } else if (ans.get(0).size() == data.size()) {
//         ans.add(data);
//     }
// }
// The code retrieves the last word in the current sequence using data.get(data.size() - 1).
// If this word is equal to targetWord, it checks whether this is the first sequence found (ans.size() == 0) or if this sequence has the same length as the already found sequences (ans.get(0).size() == data.size()).
// If either condition is true, the sequence data is added to ans.
// 6. Generate Possible Next Words:
// java
// Copy code
// for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
//     for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
//         char[] original = word.toCharArray();
//         original[i] = ch;
//         String remdata = new String(original);
//         if (set.contains(remdata)) {
//             data.add(remdata);
//             ArrayList<String> temp = new ArrayList<>(data);
//             q.add(temp);
//             usedonlevel.add(remdata);
//             data.remove(data.size() - 1);
//         }
//     }
// }
// The code attempts to generate all possible words that differ by just one character from the current word.
// For each character position in word, it tries replacing the character with every letter from 'a' to 'z'.
// If the newly generated word (remdata) exists in set, it is a valid transformation.
// The word is added to data, and a copy of this updated sequence (temp) is added to the queue q.
// The word remdata is also added to usedonlevel so it can be removed from set at the next level.
// Finally, the word is removed from data to backtrack and try the next possible transformation.
// 7. Return the Result:
// java
// Copy code
// return ans;
// After the BFS completes, the code returns ans, which contains all the shortest transformation sequences from startWord to targetWord.
// Summary:
// The code performs a BFS to explore all possible sequences of transformations from startWord to targetWord.
// It keeps track of the shortest sequences and ensures that only those are added to the result.
// The level management and word removal ensure that the BFS efficiently explores only the shortest paths.
