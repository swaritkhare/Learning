Q & A
What is the difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling?
-
Vertical scaling involves adding more resources like RAM or upgrading the CPU of a single server, which is easy but limited. Horizontal scaling, on the other hand, involves adding replicas of the server to handle subsets of requests, allowing for almost infinite scaling and redundancy without requiring high-end machines.

Why is a load balancer necessary in a horizontally scaled system?
-
A load balancer is needed to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple servers, preventing any single server from being overloaded while others are underutilized. It also provides fault tolerance by ensuring that if one server fails, others can continue to handle requests.

What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and how does it work?
-
A CDN is a network of servers distributed worldwide that serves static files like images, videos, and sometimes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It works by caching copies of files from the origin server onto CDN servers, which can be done on a push or pull basis, reducing latency and improving load times for users.

What is the purpose of caching in computer networks?
-
Caching is used to create copies of data so that it can be retrieved faster in the future. It reduces the need for repeated network requests, which can be expensive in terms of time and resources, by storing data at various levels, from browser cache to CPU cache.

How does the Domain Name System (DNS) translate domain names to IP addresses?
-
The DNS is a decentralized service that maps domain names to IP addresses using DNS records, such as the A record for address mapping. When a DNS query is made, the system uses these records to retrieve the corresponding IP address, which is then cached by the operating system to avoid repeated queries.

What is the main advantage of using HTTP over TCP for web browsing?
-
HTTP is an application-level protocol built on top of TCP that provides a higher level of abstraction, making it easier for developers to work with. It follows the client-server model and includes methods like GET and POST, which simplify the process of sending and receiving data over the internet without worrying about individual data packets.

What are the main differences between REST and GraphQL API patterns?
-
REST is a standardization for HTTP APIs that makes them stateless and follows consistent guidelines, using different HTTP status codes to indicate success or error. GraphQL, introduced by Facebook, allows clients to make a single request and specify exactly which resources they need, reducing over-fetching and the number of requests made.

How does gRPC differ from REST in terms of performance?
-
gRPC uses protocol buffers, which serialize data into a binary format that is more storage-efficient and faster to send over a network compared to JSON used in REST APIs. This results in a performance boost, especially for server-to-server communication.

What is the purpose of Websockets and how do they differ from HTTP?
-
Websockets provide bi-directional communication, allowing for real-time data transfer between a client and server. Unlike HTTP, which requires polling to check for new data, Websockets push updates immediately when new data is available, making them ideal for applications like chat apps.

Why are databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL preferred over storing data in text files?
-
Databases offer more efficient data storage using data structures like B-trees and allow for fast retrieval of data through SQL queries. They are also ACID-compliant, ensuring durability, isolation, atomicity, and consistency, which are crucial for maintaining data integrity.

What is the CAP theorem and how does it relate to database design?
-
The CAP theorem states that in the presence of a network partition, a database can only guarantee two out of three properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. It helps database designers make trade-offs in replicated systems, often choosing between consistency and availability based on the system's requirements.

What is message queuing and how does it benefit a system with high data intake?
-
Message queuing involves using a system like a message queue to persist data before it can be processed, especially when the system receives more data than it can handle. This not only helps in managing data flow but also decouples different parts of an application, improving system architecture and reliability.

Keywords
üí°Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling refers to the process of increasing the capacity of a server by adding more resources such as RAM or upgrading the CPU. It is a straightforward method to scale up a system, but it has limitations as there is a physical maximum to how much a single server can be upgraded. In the video, it is mentioned as an initial approach to scaling an application, but it is later contrasted with horizontal scaling as a more limited option.

üí°Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal scaling is the practice of adding more servers or replicas to handle a growing number of requests, allowing for nearly infinite scalability. This method is more complex but offers redundancy and fault tolerance, as it eliminates the single point of failure present in vertical scaling. The video emphasizes the power of horizontal scaling in building scalable applications and introduces the concept of load balancers to manage traffic distribution among servers.

üí°Load Balancer
A load balancer is a server that acts as a reverse proxy and directs incoming network traffic to the appropriate server or service based on the load balancing algorithm used. It plays a crucial role in horizontal scaling by distributing client requests evenly across multiple servers, ensuring no single server becomes a bottleneck. The script mentions algorithms like round-robin and hashing as methods for load balancing.

üí°Content Delivery Network (CDN)
A Content Delivery Network is a distributed network of servers that deliver static files like images, videos, and web assets to users from the server closest to them. CDNs improve the performance and availability of web content by reducing latency and bandwidth usage. The video script explains how CDNs work by caching and distributing copies of data from the origin server to various geographical locations.

üí°Caching
Caching is a technique used to store copies of data temporarily in various levels of a system, from browser cache to CPU cache, to speed up data retrieval. The video script discusses caching in the context of network requests and system memory, highlighting its role in reducing the cost and time of fetching data.

üí°IP Address
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to devices on a network, allowing them to communicate with each other. The video script touches on the importance of IP addresses in computer networking and how they are used in conjunction with the Internet Protocol Suite for data transmission.

üí°TCP/IP
TCP/IP, also known as the Internet Protocol Suite, is a set of communication protocols used for transmitting data over the internet. The video script explains that TCP ensures reliable data transmission by reordering and resending missing packets, which is why it is the foundation for many other protocols like HTTP and WebSockets.

üí°Domain Name System (DNS)
The Domain Name System is a decentralized service that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. The video script describes how DNS works, with the creation of A records to map domain names to server IP addresses, and the caching of these records by operating systems to reduce the need for frequent DNS queries.

üí°HTTP
HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is an application-level protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. The video script explains that HTTP operates on top of TCP and follows a client-server model, with requests and responses structured with headers and bodies. It also introduces different API patterns built on HTTP, such as REST and GraphQL.

üí°REST
REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications, where APIs are stateless and follow uniform interface constraints. The video script mentions REST as a popular API pattern that uses HTTP methods and status codes to communicate the outcome of requests, with 200 indicating success and 400 or 500 indicating client or server errors, respectively.

üí°GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries against data sources. Introduced by Facebook, it allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. The video script contrasts GraphQL with REST, highlighting its ability to fetch multiple resources in a single request.

üí°gRPC
gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework developed by Google, which uses protocol buffers for efficient, binary serialization of data. The video script describes gRPC as an improvement over REST APIs for server-to-server communication and mentions gRPC-web for browser support, emphasizing the performance benefits of using protocol buffers over JSON.

üí°WebSockets
WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection, allowing servers to push data to clients immediately as it becomes available. The video script explains how WebSockets solve the problem of real-time communication in applications like chat apps, where HTTP polling would be inefficient.

üí°SQL Database
SQL databases, or relational database management systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL, store data in a structured format using rows and tables. The video script discusses how SQL databases offer ACID compliance, ensuring data integrity and reliability, and contrasts them with NoSQL databases, which sacrifice some of these properties for scalability.

üí°NoSQL Database
NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use traditional tables and are designed for horizontal scaling and flexibility in data models. The video script explains that NoSQL databases drop the consistency requirement of ACID and the concept of relations, allowing for different types of databases like key-value stores, document stores, and graph databases.

üí°Sharding
Sharding is a technique used to distribute data across multiple machines in a database to improve scalability. The video script describes sharding in the context of NoSQL databases, where a shard key determines the partitioning of data, allowing for horizontal scaling without the need for strict consistency.

üí°Replication
Replication in databases involves making copies of data to improve read scalability and provide redundancy. The video script discusses two types of replication: leader-follower, where all writes go to a leader and are then replicated to followers, and leader-leader, where every replica can handle reads and writes but may lead to inconsistency.

üí°CAP Theorem
The CAP theorem states that in the presence of a network partition, a distributed database can only guarantee two out of three desirable properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. The video script explains the trade-offs involved in replicated database design and mentions the more nuanced PACELC theorem as an alternative.

üí°Message Queue
A message queue is a tool used to decouple and asynchronously process data in a system. The video script describes how message queues can handle situations where data is being received faster than it can be processed, allowing for persistent storage before processing and enabling different parts of an application to operate independently.
